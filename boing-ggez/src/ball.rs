                    // pretty simple calculation. Let's take a ball which is travelling at 1 metre per second to the right,
                    // and 2 metres per second down. Imagine this is taking place in space, so gravity isn't a factor.
                    // After the ball hits the bat, it's still going to be moving at 2 m/s down, but it's now going to be
                    // moving 1 m/s to the left instead of right. So its speed on the y-axis hasn't changed, but its
                    // direction on the x-axis has been reversed. This is extremely easy to code - "self.dx = -self.dx".
                    // However, games don't have to perfectly reflect reality.
                    // In Pong, hitting the ball with the upper or lower parts of the bat would make it bounce diagonally
                    // upwards or downwards respectively. This gives the player a degree of control over where the ball
                    // goes. To make for a more interesting game, we want to use realistic physics as the starting point,
                    // but combine with this the ability to influence the direction of the ball. When the ball hits the
                    // bat, we're going to deflect the ball slightly upwards or downwards depending on where it hit the
                    // bat. This gives the player a bit of control over where the ball goes.
